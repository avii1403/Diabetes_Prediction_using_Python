# Diabetes Prediction using Python
The "Diabetes Prediction using Python and Streamlit" project represents a pivotal fusion of machine learning, Python programming, and user-friendly web application development. In an age where health awareness and early disease detection are paramount, this project aims to empower individuals with a tool for assessing their risk of diabetes. At its core lies a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, meticulously trained on a diabetes dataset, and a Streamlit web application designed for seamless user interaction.
